### How to use?
The database has its own type of view. It will search all notes depending on many types of sources (folder, tags, links, and dataview query). Then it will show the columns/metadata that you specify. Check our [documentation](https://rafaelgb.github.io/obsidian-db-folder/features/Columns/) for more information.

The information you add or edit will be saved into the target obsidian note.
